                <td>The CSS z-index property specifies how far back or how far forward an element will appear on a web page when it overlaps other elements.
                    The z-index property uses integer values, which can be positive or negative values. The element with the highest z-index value will be at the foreground, while the element with the lowest z-index value will be at the back.</td>

                <td>When the position has a value of fixed, it is set/pinned to a specific spot on the page. The fixed element stays the same regardless of scrolling. The navigation bar is a great example of an element that is often set to position:fixed</td>

                <td>The value absolute enables an element to ignore sibling elements and instead be positioned relative to its closest parent element that is positioned with relative or absolute. Absolute value removes an element from the document flow. Then you can position with top, left, bottom, and right accordingly as you need.</td>

                <td>Enables an element to be positioned relative to where it would have originally been on a web page. The offset properties can be used to determine the actual position of the element relative to its original position. Without the offset properties, this declaration will have no effect on its positioning.</td>

                <td><code>float: left</code></td>
                <td>The float property determines how far left or how far right an element should float within its parent element. The value left floats an element to the left side of its container and the value right floats an element to the right side of its container. In order for float to work, the width of the container must be specified or the element will assume the full width of its containing element.</td>
